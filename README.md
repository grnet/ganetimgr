# ganetimgr

`ganetimgr` is a web platform that eases the provisioning of virtual machines over multiple `ganeti` clusters.
It leverages Ganeti's RAPI functionality to administer the clusters, and is stateless from the VM perspective.
The project is written in `Django` and uses Bootstrap for the frontend.
In essence, ganetimgr aims to be the frontend of a VPS service.
